                          As smart phones continue becoming more powerful, consumers rely on them more often, and for more complex functionality.  When designing a web application I consider how it will look and function on a mobile device first, then build out the application accordingly.

                          When I design a User Interface I take many factors into consideration.  Not everyone is a computer expert.  My first priority is to design a UI that anyone can intuitively use.  I take the time to add help pages, FAQs, tooltips, instructional videos, or whatever is necessary to inform the user about app functionality, on a case by case basis.

                          I will work as hard as I can and apply my best effort when designing a web application.  A web application is an extension of the person, business or organization that it represents.  My work is a reflection of myself and my client/employer.  I take this principle very seriously.  My work will represent US in the best possible light.
